# Pipeline: Parallelism Detection
## Overview
The Parallelism Detection API is built on top of the Hugging Face Transformers library and utilizes a custom pre-trained model to predict whether parallelism exists within a given code snippet. The API provides a simple and efficient way to detect parallelism in code without manual inspection or using complex code analysis tools.

## Getting Started
To use the Parallelism Detection API, you will need to install the HPCFAIR Transformers library. Please refer to the [installation](../0_index/installation.md).
